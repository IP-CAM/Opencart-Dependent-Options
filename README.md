Opencart-Dependent-Options
==========================
Opencart = an awesome simple webshop system. Although there is one issue that I think needs some attention. That is that as a webshop owner you are limited to the standard options systems.
There are extensions, but are not nearly as close to what I think would extend Opencart greatly. Creating dependent options and product configuration system for opencart. The goal is to create an extensions that will extend the basic opencart options system.

Goal to create a extension with which:
- Webshop owners can set up a step by step product configuration system;
- Webshop owners can configure the number of steps;
- Each step can be configured and is dependent;
- Each option can be configured individually (price, image etc.);

This extension will probably change the way admins add and delete products significant;
